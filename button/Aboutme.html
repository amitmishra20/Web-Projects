                    I’m Amit, a passionate and growth-driven Computer Science undergraduate, currently pursuing B.Tech
                    with a specialization in Data Science. I'm on a mission to transform my life by building strong
                    technical skills and creating real-world impact through technology. With a disciplined mindset, I'm
                    committed to mastering Web Development, Data Science with AI, and DSA, aiming to secure a
                    high-impact role in a top tech company like J.P. Morgan.

                    My journey is fueled by self-awareness, deep curiosity, and a constant desire to learn. I believe in
                    consistency over motivation and progress over perfection. I'm actively building projects, solving
                    problems, and investing time into becoming not just job-ready but future-ready.

                    I envision a life of freedom, happiness, and purpose — where my work creates value and my success
                    makes my family proud. I value clean design, meaningful code, deep thinking, and living a calm,
                    focused life.
